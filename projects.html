      Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Cars<br>

      <br>
      Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter based fusion of sensor data (Lidar and Radar) has been implemented on Udacity Simulator for Autonomous Cars. EKF linearizes the non-linear (radar observations to state space transfer) function by first order approximation. But since this approximation is not a good idea, UKF overcomes the problem by generating sigma points and transfering them and fitting gaussian. This procedure is repeated and the non linear function is used as it is without approximations.

      <br>
      Particle Filter can fit multi model estimate instead of Gaussian. Since if there are two similar rooms, gaussian might have to choose between one of the them but particle filter assumes it is in both (if there is no prior as of then). This is more robust, but computationally intensive with more particles.

      Tracking Lane Lines is very important in perception module of Self Driving Car Domain. To perform this the algorithm is tested on several videos of road taken from forward facing camera of a car. Gaussian noise is added for blur effect to the videos. The algorithm uses canny edge detector to detect edges and extra noise like trees from image are removed by selecting Region of Interest (ROI). Hough Transform is used to find lines and those lines are extrapolated to get left and right lane lines.

      Better gradient (Laplacian, sobel) and thresholding is done in different color spaces (HLS). Perspective transform is done and polynomial is fitted and warped back which gives better results detecting curved road than just straight lines.

      Inertial Odometry using LSTM<br>

      <a href="https://github.com/srikanthmalla/inertial_odom"> GitHub Repository LSTM RNN Inertial Odometry</a><br>
      Estimation of egomotion is very important for Self Driving Cars and UAVs. Existing inertial odometry calculation were not good because they couldn't capture exact noise model. So, Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) is used to predict relative motion between two camera frames, as some times huge motions couldn't be captured by visual odometry (because of no correspondences in images), then extra sensor like Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used to capture that motion, this gives advantage of predicting better ego motion and could be fused be visual odometry.

      Industrial Inspection (like examining cracks in industrial boilers) takes lot of time and money. Using UAVs both of those factors could be cut down effectively. The aim of this project is automating an UAV to do this task. It is equipped with Hukoyu laser scanner (LIDAR), onboard sensors (camera, IMU), controller (DJI Naza M) and computer (Odroid). Mesh is generated automatically from 3D pointcloud map and a initial 3D coverage plan (path and velocities) is generated considering the noise model (empirically calculated controller uncertainty). Raycasting is done to track the covered regions and realtime coverage planner adjusts its path optimizing flight time.

      UGVs are widely used in warehouse management by Amazon and other companies. But they are mostly limited to moving the platforms but do not perform intelligent pick and place operations. Inspired by this idea an Autonomous Ground Robot equipped with a 3DOF robotic arm to manipulate things is built from scratch using 3D Modeling and Designing. For 3D mapping and Localization with Kinect camera RTABMap is used. A simple PID control is used for 3DOF robotic arm, and also for an extra application of person following in markets.
